# Movietheater project Ruben Stoop, 670240, Klas HAINF2B

Welcome to my movietheater project.
Hopefully the project starts up succesfully
I have added csv and pdf packages which should install automatically

Instructions (These could differ for everyone slightly. This works for me):

1. PomXML reload 
2. Pomxml -> Maven -> Download sources and documentation
4. Open up the Maven tab (on the right side of your screen)
5. Perform: LifeCycle > clean + install
6. Perform: Plugins > javafx > javafx:run


IF YOU ARE ON LAPTOP WITH A ZOOM IT IS RECOMMENDED TO USE FULLSCREEN!
